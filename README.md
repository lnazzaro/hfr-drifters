# hfr-drifters
This toolbox processes drifter data (from netcdf files with structured as in the included template) to velocities at timestamps matching HFR data, and matches drifter data to nearby radials and totals data. Plotting routines to compare drifter data to HFR data are included in stats_and_imagery subdirectory. See wiki (in progress) for detailed instructions on toolbox.
